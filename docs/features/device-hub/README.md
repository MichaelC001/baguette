# Xcode 27's Device Hub and the input surface

Xcode 27 replaced Simulator.app with **Device Hub**, which attaches a HID daemon
of its own to every booted simulator. The iOS 27 runtime then tears down the
legacy input services baguette drives: `baguette tap` / `swipe` / `press` still
print `{"ok":true}` and the device never sees the event
([#77](https://github.com/tddworks/baguette/issues/77)). baguette heals it —
[`baguette boot`](../../commands.md#baguette-boot) does it unasked,
[`baguette heal`](../../commands.md#baguette-heal) does it on demand.

## Quick start

```bash
baguette boot --udid <UDID>            # boots, waits, heals if Device Hub attached
baguette heal --udid <UDID>            # heal a device booted some other way, or one
                                       # Device Hub was opened on later
```

`baguette boot --no-heal` opts out.

| Surface | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `baguette boot` | Boots, waits for the boot to finish, heals if Device Hub attached. |
| `baguette heal` | Heals on demand. |
| `POST /simulators/<UDID>/boot` | Same heal as the CLI boot, after `{"ok":true}` is decided. |
| `baguette input` startup | One advisory on stderr naming `baguette heal` when the surface is shadowed. |
| `baguette serve` stream attach | Same advisory in the server log, per WebSocket. |

## Check whether a device is shadowed

```bash
xcrun simctl spawn <UDID> notifyutil -g com.apple.coredevice.dtuhidd.active
```

`… 1` means Device Hub attached during this backboardd's life, which is exactly
the condition that needs healing. Xcode 26 runtimes never publish the key and
read as `0`; so does a device that is shut down.

## HTTP

```
POST /simulators/<UDID>/boot   → {"ok":true}, then heals if Device Hub attached
```

## Gotchas

- **Healing kills running apps.** It restarts backboardd, and SpringBoard with
  it. The device is not rebooted and is back in about four seconds. That's why
  `boot` does it unasked — nothing is running yet — while `input` / `serve`
  sessions only advise.
- **Buttons and keyboard are dead whenever Device Hub has attached.** Touch
  may or may not survive, depending on a ~100 ms boot race; don't read a
  working tap as "nothing to heal".
- **It comes back after relaunching Device Hub.** The healed state holds until
  dtuhidd itself restarts, i.e. until you quit and relaunch Device Hub. The
  advisory then returns, and `baguette heal` repairs it again.
- **It can't be prevented at boot.** Heal after the fact.
- **`baguette lifetime` doesn't apply.** It writes Simulator.app's preferences;
  Device Hub ignores them, and quitting Device Hub shuts every booted device
  down. No Device Hub equivalent has been found yet.

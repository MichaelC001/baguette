  Guide for implementing features in baguette — a Swift CLI + WebSocket server
  that drives iOS simulators via private SimulatorKit. Use this skill when:
  (1) Adding a new gesture, button, keyboard surface, stream format, or
      device-chrome behaviour (anything that lands across Domain / Infrastructure /
      App + Resources/Web).
  (2) Extending an existing wire-protocol envelope, CLI subcommand, or HTTP route.
  (3) User asks "add feature X to baguette", "implement <gesture>", "wire <new
      verb> through serve / input / CLI", or similar.
  (4) Touching the iOS-26 SimulatorKit / IndigoHID surface — those edits MUST
      go through this skill's Architecture phase before code lands.
  Avoid using this skill for refactors that don't add a new feature (keep those
  TDD-driven without the architecture-approval gate).

# Implement a feature in baguette

baguette is a **CLI + WebSocket server**, not a SwiftUI app. There is no
ViewModel layer, no async actors in the input path — gestures are
synchronous `Bool`-returning calls into the `@Mockable` `Input`
abstraction whose only concrete adapter is `IndigoHIDInput`. The frontend
is hand-written vanilla JS IIFEs (no bundler) that talk to the server
via one WebSocket per stream.

**Naming abstractions**: every `@Mockable protocol` in this codebase is
a **domain noun for the role it plays** — `Input`, `Screen`,
`Accessibility`, `LogStream`, `DeviceHost`, `Subprocess`, `Chromes`,
`Simulators`. The pattern-label suffixes **"Port" / "Service" /
"Manager" never appear**. If you reach for `XxxPort`, the abstraction
isn't named yet — keep going until the noun describes what the thing
*is* in the domain.

**Repository is allowed — but only for aggregate CRUD, and only
named as the collection noun.** A protocol that is genuinely a DDD
collection-like interface for an aggregate root (load / save / delete
by identity) takes the **plural of the aggregate** — `Simulators`,
`Chromes`, `Books`, `Orders` — not `BookRepository` / `OrderRepo`. The
suffix `Repository` is still banned; the *role* (aggregate persistence)
is the legitimate case the plural-noun convention already covers.
If your protocol isn't aggregate persistence (it's an adapter, an
event source, a process boundary, …), the repository carve-out
doesn't apply — pick a role-noun like `Subprocess` / `LogStream`
instead.

Read [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) — the "TDD is non-negotiable" gate,
the naming rule, and the orchestrator-vs-collaborator split for adapters
that wrap 3rd-party I/O are authoritative there. This skill describes
the **process** of adding features that fit those rules.

## Phase 0: Architecture Design (mandatory)

For any feature that crosses a layer boundary or touches the
SimulatorKit / IndigoHID / AXPTranslator / spawn surface, **stop and
design before coding**. Briefly produce:

1. **Wire shape** — the JSON envelope on `baguette serve` WS / `baguette input` stdin. Field names, optional vs required, default values.
2. **CLI surface** — subcommand + flag names. Match existing patterns (`--udid`, `--width`, `--height`).
3. **Domain types** — value types (struct/enum) and which `@Mockable` abstraction is added/changed. Rich domain: behaviour lives on the value, not in a service (`DeviceButton.press`, `KeyboardKey.press` are the templates). **Name new abstractions for their domain role** — `Subprocess`, `DeviceHost`, `Accessibility`. **Never `XxxPort` / `XxxService` / `XxxManager`, and never the suffix `XxxRepository`.** If the abstraction *is* aggregate CRUD (load / save / delete by identity for an aggregate root), name it as the **plural collection noun** — `Simulators`, `Chromes`, `Books`. If the noun isn't obvious, the abstraction probably shouldn't exist yet.
4. **Adapter changes** — how the production class (`IndigoHIDInput`, `AXPTranslatorAccessibility`, `SimDeviceLogStream`, …) handles it. Which private-API symbol, which arg shape. Flag iOS-26-specific gotchas explicitly (signature drift between idb/AXe and Xcode 26 has burned us before — see [`buttons/design.md`](../../../docs/features/buttons/design.md) for the canonical example).
5. **I/O split (only when the adapter wraps 3rd-party I/O)** — read [AGENTS.md's "Splitting an adapter that wraps 3rd-party I/O"](../../../AGENTS.md#splitting-an-adapter-that-wraps-3rd-party-io) section and pick a pattern:
   - **One-shot fetch** (single private-API call → operate on the value): lift the post-fetch logic into a pure static factory in `Domain/` (`AXNode.walk(from:transform:)`, `AXFrameTransform`, `LineBuffer`). The adapter shrinks to "make the call, hand the result to the static factory." No new abstraction needed.
   - **Conversational I/O** (start / stream / signal-exit / terminate): introduce one small `@Mockable` collaborator named like a domain noun (`Subprocess`, never `LogProcessPort`). The orchestrator depends on `any Subprocess`; tests inject `MockSubprocess`. The concrete impl (`HostSubprocess` ~30–50 LOC) is integration-only and should be excluded from coverage.
6. **Frontend** — does the browser need to send / receive this? If yes, which IIFE(s) change.

Present a short ASCII diagram + a "files to touch" list, then **ask
the user to approve** before writing code. The cost of a wrong
SimulatorKit signature is a `backboardd` crash, not just a failing test.

### Architecture diagram templates

**Gesture-style feature** (single private-API call, no conversation):

**Conversational-I/O feature** (start / stream / terminate — split
the orchestrator from the host-process collaborator):

```

       CLI ─── ArgumentParser ┤                 └──────────────────────┘
       WS  ─── /…/<feature> route
```

## Phase 1: Domain TDD

Write the failing test FIRST, in `Tests/BaguetteTests/<Context>/`.

Patterns that already exist — match them:

- **Pure value types** — `struct Foo: Equatable, Sendable { … }`. Add
  `Hashable` only if a Set / Dictionary key actually needs it.
- **Rich domain methods** — verbs live on the value:
  ```swift
  extension DeviceButton {
      func press(duration: Double = 0, on input: any Input) -> Bool {
          input.button(self, duration: duration)
      }
  }
  ```
- **Gesture protocol** — wire DTO with `static let wireType` + `static
  func parse` + `func execute(on input: any Input)`. The body of
  `execute` should be one line that delegates to a rich-domain method.
- **Field extractors** — use `Field.requiredString` / `requiredDouble`
  / `optionalDouble`. Don't open-code `dict["…"] as? Double`.

Example test rhythm (from `KeyboardTests.swift`):

```swift
@Suite("KeyboardKey")
struct KeyboardKeyTests {
    @Test func `parses lowercase letter wire codes onto HID page 7`() {
        #expect(KeyboardKey.from(wireCode: "KeyA")?.hidUsage
            == HIDUsage(page: 7, usage: 0x04))
    }
}
```

Run `swift test --filter <Suite>` after each red→green cycle.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure TDD

`@Mockable` abstractions in this layer get auto-generated `MockXxx`
companions; tests substitute the mock and assert on returned state:

```swift
let input = MockInput()
given(input).key(.any, modifiers: .any, duration: .any).willReturn(true)

KeyboardKey.from(wireCode: "KeyA")!.press(modifiers: [.shift], on: input)
verify(input).key(.value(_), modifiers: .value([.shift]), duration: .value(0))
    .called(1)
```

If the feature needs a new method on an existing abstraction, add it
to the protocol with a doc comment, then update the production
adapter. **Do not** introduce a parallel hierarchy just to enable
testing — `IndigoHIDInput` is allowed to be the only `Input` impl.

### Adapter wraps 3rd-party I/O? Pick the split.

If your adapter touches a private framework, `Foundation.Process`,
`dlopen`, `Pipe`, `kill(pid)`, or any external XPC, **do not pile
all of that into one class**. Use one of the two splits.

**(a) One-shot fetch — pure factory in Domain.** When the
private-API call is "make one call, get a value back, operate on the
value" (`AXPTranslator.frontmostApplicationWithDisplayId:` returns
one `AXPMacPlatformElement`), lift the post-fetch logic into a pure
static factory in Domain and drive it with `Fake…` `NSObject`s that
override KVC / selectors. The adapter shrinks to "make the call,
hand the result to the factory." Examples:

- `AXNode.walk(from rootElement: NSObject, transform: AXFrameTransform, depthCap:, deadline:) -> AXNode`
- `AXFrameTransform.map(_ macFrame: CGRect) -> CGRect`
- `LineBuffer.append(_ bytes: Data) -> [String]`
- `AXElementReader.string/bool/frame/children(...)`

These all live in `Domain/<Context>/`, are exercised by direct unit
tests, and the Infrastructure adapter calls them after the
irreducible private-API call.

**(b) Conversational I/O — domain-named collaborator.** When the
adapter has a real conversation with the outside (`start` → many
`onBytes` → `onExit`, plus a `terminate` poke), pure helpers don't
capture the state machine cleanly. Introduce one small `@Mockable`
collaborator in Domain, named like a noun for what it *is*
(`Subprocess`, never `LogProcessPort`):

```swift
@Mockable
protocol Subprocess: AnyObject, Sendable {
    func run(executable: URL, arguments: [String],
             onBytes: @escaping @Sendable (Data) -> Void,
             onExit:  @escaping @Sendable (Int32) -> Void) throws
    func terminate()
}
```

The orchestrator depends on `any Subprocess`. Tests inject
`MockSubprocess` and drive every byte/exit/terminate path. The
concrete impl (`HostSubprocess` ~30–50 LOC, wraps
`Foundation.Process`) is the **only** integration-only file —
exclude it from coverage targets and rely on a manual smoke test.

### Coverage expectation per file

After the split:
- Domain pure factories / value types: **100%** unit-tested.
- Orchestrator (`<Feature>Orchestrator` or `Sim<Feature>Stream`): **≥ 90%** unit-tested via the collaborator's `MockXxx`.
- `Host<Collaborator>` (the irreducible call): integration-only, excluded from coverage.

If you can't get the orchestrator into a `MockXxx`-driven test, it's
not split correctly — go back to Phase 0.

### When the adapter calls private SimulatorKit symbols

For `IndigoHIDInput` (and any future direct private-symbol caller):

- Resolve the symbol in `resolveFunctions()` and log presence in the
  `[hid] symbols resolved …` line.
- Match the arg signature against a verified open-source bridge (see
  the `kittyfarm` typedef approach used for the buttons feature in
  [`docs/features/buttons/design.md`](../../../docs/features/buttons/design.md)) —
  guessing the signature from older `idb` / AXe code has burned us
  before.
- Add `log(...)` lines at each branch (symbol resolved, message
  built non-nil, sent) so users can see exactly where dispatch dies.
- Bracket multi-step sequences (modifiers, two-finger holds) with
  matching down/up pairs; never leave a key/modifier latched.

## Phase 3: Wiring

Each new gesture / verb flows through the same checklist:

1. **`GestureRegistry.standard`** — one `r.register(<Verb>.self)`
   line in `Domain/Input/GestureRegistry.swift`.
2. **CLI subcommand** — new `struct …Command: ParsableCommand` in
   `App/Commands/GestureCommands.swift` (or a sibling). Add to
   `RootCommand.subcommands`. Update `CommandParsingTests`.
3. **Server WS** — usually nothing: `Server.streamWS` already routes
   wire JSON through `GestureDispatcher.dispatch(line:)`. New behaviour
   only if you're adding a *control* verb that bypasses the gesture
   path.
4. **Browser** — when the feature is user-facing:
   - Add the wire field handling to `Resources/Web/sim-input-bridge.js`
     (translate plugin dialect → baguette wire).
   - Expose a method on `SimInput` in `sim-input.js`.
   - If a new DOM-driven module is needed, write a single-purpose
     IIFE that hangs one class on `window`, add a `<script>` tag in
     `sim.html` (and `farm/farm.html` if the farm path uses it),
     and mount it from `sim-native.js` and/or `farm/farm-tile.js`.
   - The frontend stays a **dumb sender**: no HID codes, no chrome
     lookups, no domain logic. The Swift side owns rich domain.
   - Small, reusable browser logic gets a `node:test` unit test —
     see [references/js-testing.md](references/js-testing.md).

A new **stream format** is one `Stream` impl in `Infrastructure/Stream/`
plus one case in `StreamFormat.makeStream`; its byte envelope lives in
`Domain/Stream/Envelope.swift`. No call site switches on the format.

## Phase 4: Docs + Changelog (mandatory before "done")

When the code is green and the feature works end-to-end, **before**
reporting completion:

### 4a. Feature doc

Follow [`docs/documentation-design/`](../../../docs/documentation-design/README.md):
each fact has one home, and every doc links instead of copying.

- **`docs/features/<feature>/README.md`** (≤200 lines), for someone
  *using* the feature: a `description:` frontmatter line (what + when,
  ≤250 chars), quick start, workflows, the feature's own HTTP /
  WebSocket routes and messages (one example each), gotchas, see also.
  No flag tables — link `../../commands.md#baguette-<cmd>`. No file maps.
  Match [`shake`](../../../docs/features/shake/README.md).
- **`docs/features/<feature>/design.md`**, only when there is research
  the code can't explain: the path to the irreducible private call,
  which symbol and arg shape, where each magic number was measured
  (spec / chrome bundle / Apple HID page), ordering that matters, dead
  ends tried, known limits in full. This is where the iOS-26 gotchas go.
- A new gesture's envelope goes in [`docs/wire.md`](../../../docs/wire.md);
  a new route gets one row in [`docs/serve.md`](../../../docs/serve.md)
  linking to the feature README.
- A limit every agent must know on every task gets **one line** in
  AGENTS.md's "Known limits", linking to the `design.md`.

### 4b. CHANGELOG

One bullet under `## [Unreleased]`, ≤300 chars (URLs excluded).
`Removed` / `Changed` before `Added`; anything incompatible starts with
`Breaking:`. Start with what the user types or clicks, say the effect —
not the type, symbol or file (those go in the PR and `design.md`) —
and end with the docs + PR links:

```md
- `baguette hinge` folds iPhone Duo to a pose or an angle, swept like Device Hub. → [docs](docs/features/hinge/README.md) ([#NN](https://github.com/tddworks/baguette/pull/NN))
```

### 4c. Generated docs

Run `make docs`: it regenerates `docs/commands.md`, the `docs/README.md`
index and the `baguette` skill's references from the binary and the
docs. Never hand-edit those. Then `make check-docs` must report nothing
new for the files you touched. Update `skills/baguette/SKILL.md`'s
"What's wired vs what isn't" list if the CLI or wire surface changed.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Reaching for `class` to hold rich domain.** Use `struct` (or
  `enum`) with extension methods. Swift structs already have methods,
  computed properties, protocol conformance, and auto-synthesised
  `Equatable` / `Hashable` / `Sendable` — everything rich domain
  needs. `final class` is reserved for boundaries that genuinely
  need reference semantics (`Server`, `IndigoHIDInput`,
  `CoreSimulators`, `LiveChromes`, `H264Encoder`). See
  [`references/domain-models.md`](references/domain-models.md) for
  the full rule.
- **Plumbing chrome (or any aggregate) into `IndigoHIDInput`.** SRP
  violation — the adapter's job is wire-format dispatch, not domain
  resolution. Resolve overrides at the call site or on the rich
  domain value.
- **Positional triples on the JS side.** `simInput.button(name, dur, hidUsage)`
  is wrong shape; either accept an options object or move the resolution
  back into Swift.
- **`type` / `key` reaching the wire as a no-op fallback.** If you
  can't implement a feature, fail loudly with a parse error — silent
  drops mid-string are worse than an explicit `{"ok":false,"error":"…"}`.
- **Adding a Mockable abstraction with one concrete impl just for
  testing.** `IndigoHIDInput` is allowed to be the only `Input` impl;
  don't invent a parallel hierarchy. The exception is the
  orchestrator + collaborator split for 3rd-party I/O — there the
  collaborator (`Subprocess`) earns its `MockSubprocess` because the
  state machine is real.
- **Naming an abstraction `XxxPort` / `XxxService` / `XxxManager`,
  or suffixing aggregate persistence with `XxxRepository`.** These
  are pattern labels, not domain nouns. The codebase uses role-named
  protocols (`Input`, `Screen`, `Accessibility`, `LogStream`,
  `DeviceHost`, `Subprocess`). For aggregate CRUD specifically, use
  the **plural collection noun** (`Simulators`, `Chromes`, `Books`)
  — not `BookRepository`. If the noun isn't obvious, the abstraction
  probably shouldn't exist yet — keep the logic inline or push it
  into a pure helper instead.
- **Cramming the irreducible private-API call AND the orchestration
  logic into one Infrastructure file.** That's the original sin
  that kept `AXPTranslatorAccessibility` and `SimDeviceLogStream` at
  18% / 33% coverage. Always split per the Phase-2 rule.
- **`MOCKING` outside the test target.** It's `.debug`-only by design
  so release builds carry no mock code. Don't reach for `MockXxx`
  from production code.

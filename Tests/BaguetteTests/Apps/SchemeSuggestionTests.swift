/// Pure-value coverage for `SchemeSuggestion` — the completion behind
/// the console's URL bar: type a few characters, get the schemes that
/// installed apps actually answer to.
///
/// Ranking carries the weight here. Apps routinely register three or
/// more schemes for one app — a readable one, a reverse-DNS one, and a
/// tool-injected dev-client one — and only the readable scheme is what a
/// developer means to type. Listing them unranked would bury the useful
/// suggestion under noise, so the ordering is a specified behaviour, not
/// an accident of dictionary iteration.

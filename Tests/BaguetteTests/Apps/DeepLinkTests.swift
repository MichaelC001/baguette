/// Pure-value coverage for `DeepLink` — what a developer means when they
/// type a URL into the console and expect it to land in their app.
///
/// The load-bearing behaviour is the routing verdict. A custom scheme
/// (`myapp://…`) reaches the app that registered it, but an `https://…`
/// universal link is handed to Safari by the simulator rather than the
/// app — long-standing simulator behaviour that every existing tool
/// (`simctl openurl`, `idb open`, Maestro's `openLink`) performs
/// silently. Modelling the verdict as a value lets the console warn
/// *before* dispatch instead of leaving the developer to wonder why
/// Safari opened.

/// the latch that lets exactly one of them through and remembers which,
/// because the answer decides what happens to SIGINT next: after a
/// Ctrl-C the user gets the signal handed back (a second press aborts a
/// long flush), and on the duration path they don't, so that their
/// *first* press can't truncate the file being written.

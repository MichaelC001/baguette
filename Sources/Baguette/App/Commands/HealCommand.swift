/// Device Hub's HID daemon attaches to a booted device, backboardd tears
/// down the legacy services baguette's touches and buttons ride and (on
/// iOS 27) never brings them back — gestures report `ok` and land
/// nowhere. This clears the state Device Hub published and restarts
/// backboardd, so it re-initialises with every legacy service live.
/// SpringBoard restarts with it: running apps are killed, the device is
/// not rebooted. `baguette boot` does the same automatically; this is
/// for a device booted some other way, or one Device Hub was opened on
/// later. See `docs/features/device-hub/README.md`.

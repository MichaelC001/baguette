/// Whether Xcode 27's Device Hub has attached its HID daemon to a
/// simulator — and with it, shadowed the legacy input surface baguette
/// drives.
///
/// Device Hub (the app that replaced Simulator.app in Xcode 27) runs a
/// per-device guest daemon, `dtuhidd`, which registers its own virtual
/// HID services inside backboardd and publishes one Darwin notify state,
/// `com.apple.coredevice.dtuhidd.active`. backboardd's `SimulatorHID`
/// watches that state and, the moment it flips to active, disconnects the
/// legacy Indigo services (`ScreenTouchService`, `MainScreenButtonsService`,
/// `ExternalKeyboardService`) baguette's `IndigoHIDInput` sends to. The
/// iOS 27 runtime then never manages to reconnect them — it re-adds a
/// dead `IOHIDServiceRef` on the first Indigo event and believes it
/// succeeded — so taps report `ok` and land nowhere, and hardware buttons
/// are gone for good. See `docs/features/device-hub/README.md` and issue #77.
///
/// The notify state is the whole detection: it is cheap to read from the
/// host (`simctl spawn <udid> notifyutil -g …`), and `1` means the surface
/// has been shadowed at least once in this backboardd's lifetime, which is
/// exactly the condition that needs healing. Per AGENTS.md's one-shot-fetch
/// split, the parse lives here; the spawn is `SimctlInputSurface`'s.
